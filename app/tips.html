                    <h1>Water Conservation </h1>
                    <h3>Water conservation in the home</h3>
                    <ol> 
            <li>Check faucets and pipes for leaks
                A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day.                       Larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons. 
            </li> 

            <li> Don't use the toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket
                Every time you flush a cigarette butt, facial tissue or other small bit of trash,                   five to seven gallons of water is wasted.
            </li> 

            <li> Check your toilets for leaks
                Put a little food coloring in your toilet tank. If, without flushing, the color                     begin to appear in the bowl within 30 minutes, you have a leak that should be                       repaired immediately. Most replacement parts are inexpensive and easy to install.
            </li>

            <li> Install water-saving shower heads and low-flow faucet aerators 
                Inexpensive water-saving low-flow shower heads or restrictors are easy for the                     homeowner to install. Also, long, hot showers can use five to ten gallons every                     unneeded minute. Limit your showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down and                 rinse off. "Low-flow" means it uses less than 2.5 gallons per minute.
                You can easily install a ShowerStart showerhead, or add a ShowerStart converter to                 existing showerheads, which automatically pauses a running shower once it gets                     warm. 
                Also, all household faucets should be fit with aerators. This single best home                     water conservation method is also the cheapest!
            </li>

            <li>
                For new installations, consider buying "low flush" toilets, which use 1 to 2                       gallons per flush instead of the usual 3 to 5 gallons.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Take shorter showers.
                One way to cut down on water use is to turn off the shower after soaping up, then                   turn it back on to rinse. A four-minute shower uses approximately 20 to 40 gallons                 of water.
            </li>

            <li>
                Turn off the water after you wet your toothbrush
                There is no need to keep the water running while brushing your teeth. Just wet your                 brush and fill a glass for mouth rinsing.
            </li>
        
            <li> 
                When washing dishes by hand, don't leave the water running for rinsing
                If your have a double-basin, fill one with soapy water and one with rinse water. If                 you have a single-basin sink, gather washed dishes in a dish rack and rinse them                   with a spray device or a panful of hot water. Dual-swivel aerators are available to                 make this easier. If using a dishwasher, there is usually no need to pre-rinse the                 dishes.
            </li> 

            <li> 
                Don't let the faucet run while you clean vegetables
                Just rinse them in a stoppered sink or a pan of clean water.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <h3> Water conservation in the yard and garden</h3> 

        <ol>
            <li>
                Don't run the hose while washing your car
                Clean the car using a pail of soapy water. Use the hose only for rinsing - this                     simple practice can save as much as 150 gallons when washing a car. Use a spray                     nozzle when rinsing for more efficient use of water. Better yet, use a waterless                   car washing system; there are several brands, such as EcoTouch, which are now on                   the market.
            </li> 
    
            <li>
                Use a broom, not a hose, to clean driveways and sidewalks 
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Check for leaks in pipes, hoses, faucets and couplings
                Leaks outside the house may not seem as bad since they're not as visible. But they                 can be just as wasteful as leaks indoors. Check frequently to keep them drip-free.                 Use hose washers at spigots and hose connections to eliminate leaks.
            </li>
